The application accepts input in the form of text and predict which blood cell migh have affected.

## Documentations on iOS Application

The iOS applicatiopn is built using swift programming language and StoryboardUI

|  Disoarder | Problem | Affected blood cell and type |
|-|-|-|
|  Thermbocythemia | Elevated platelet count | Platelets (Thermbocyte) |
|  Thermbocytopenia | Low platelet count | Platelets (Thermbocyte) |
